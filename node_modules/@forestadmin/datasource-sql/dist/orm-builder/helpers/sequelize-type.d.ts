     * This workaround is needed because when inserting records in a table with an Array<Enum> column,
     * sequelize will try to cast the value to the enum type.
     *
     * This will fail if the database that sequelize is connected to was not initially created by
     * sequelize, because the enum type is unlikely to have the name that sequelize expects.
